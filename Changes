0.03    BUGFIXES:
         * Better handling of write-only Notifiers

0.02    CHANGES:
         * Use low-level IO::Epoll interface (epoll_ctl() etc..) instead of
           high-level IO::Poll-alike object wrapper. Should be better
           performance, and less buggy - doesn't depend on poor IO::Poll-like
           emulation details.

0.01    First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
